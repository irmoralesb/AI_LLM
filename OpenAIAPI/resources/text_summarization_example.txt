Client (María S.):
Hi, my wireless headphones stopped charging. They just don’t turn on anymore. Can someone help?

Support (Daniel R.):
Hello María! I’m sorry to hear your headphones aren’t charging. I’ll be happy to assist. May I have the model name and approximate purchase date?

Client:
Sure. They’re the AeroSound H300, bought around May last year.

Support:
Thanks! Let me check…
The AeroSound H300 has a 24-month manufacturer warranty, so you should still be covered.

Before we process a warranty claim, can you confirm if the charging LED lights up at all when plugging them in?

Client:
No, nothing lights up. I tried two cables and two chargers.

Support:
Perfect, thanks for testing that. Given the symptoms and the fact that you already tried alternate chargers, it sounds like a hardware failure in the charging module.

We can replace the unit under warranty at no cost.

I just need:
• A photo of the serial number (usually on the left earcup inside).
• Proof of purchase (a photo or PDF is fine).
• Your shipping address.

Client:
Ok! I’ll send everything right now. How long will the replacement take?

Support:
Once we receive the photos and validate the warranty, we ship the replacement within 2–3 business days. Delivery typically takes 5–7 business days depending on your location. You’ll also receive a prepaid label to send the defective unit back.

Client:
Great, thank you. I’ll upload the documents in a minute.

Support:
You’re very welcome, María! As soon as you send them, I’ll take care of the rest.
