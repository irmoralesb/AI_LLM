    "* **prompt**: The textual instruction that describes what image we want the model to generate.\n",
    "* **background**: The type of background for the image. It must be one of \"`transparent`\", \"`opaque`\", or \"`auto`\". The default value is \"`auto`\", in which the model will decide based on the content what the best background type is. *Note that JPEG images don't support transparent backgrounds*.\n",
    "* **n**: The number of images to generate. Must be a number from 1 to 10.\n",
    "* **quality**: The quality of the generated image. It must be one of \"`high`\", \"`medium`\", or \"`low`\", with the default being \"`high`\".\n",
    "* **size**: The size of the image in pixels. It must be one of \"`1024x1024`\" (square), \"`1536x1024`\" (landscape), \"`1024x1536`\" (portrait).\n",
    "* **output_format**: The image format. It must be one of \"`png`\", \"`jpeg`\", or \"`webp`\". The default is \"`png`\".\n",
    "* **moderation**: The level of content moderation. Must be either \"`low`\" for a less restrictive filter or \"`auto`\", which is the default.\n",
