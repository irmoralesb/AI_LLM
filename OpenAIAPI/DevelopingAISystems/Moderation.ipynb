      "\n",
      "1. **Transportation**: (Flights, gas, rental car, public transport)\n",

      "2. **Accommodation**: (Hotels, hostels, vacation rentals)\n",

      "5. **Miscellaneous Expenses**: (Souvenirs, travel insurance, tips)\n",
      "   - Budget: $50 - $100\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 3: Research Costs\n",
      "- **Transportation**: Look up flight or driving costs, rental car prices, and public transport options.\n",
      "- **Accommodation**: Compare prices on hotel booking sites, look for deals or consider budget options like Airbnb or hostels.\n",
      "- **Food**: Research average meal prices at your destination. Consider a mix of dining out and self-catering.\n",
      "- **Activities**: Check pricing for attractions you intend to visit, and look for discounts or package deals.\n",
      "- **Miscellaneous**: Plan for tips and any small purchases.\n",

      "### Step 5: Set Aside a Contingency Fund\n",
      "Allocate a small portion of your budget (10-15%) for unexpected expenses. This could be around $80 - $120.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 6: Prioritize Spending\n",
      "If your estimated costs exceed $800, prioritize essential expenses and consider adjusting your plans:\n",
      "- Choose a more budget-friendly destination.\n",
      "- Look for alternative accommodations.\n",
      "- Limit costly activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 7: Finalize Your Budget\n",
      "Revise and finalize your budget, ensuring it aligns with your trip goals and preferences. Consider sharing the plan with fellow travelers if it's a group trip.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 8: Monitor Your Spending\n",
      "During the trip, keep track of your expenses to ensure you stay within the budget. Use a budgeting app or keep receipts for easy tracking.\n",
